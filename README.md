# Source-based morphometry for multi-centre MRI studies
## Project Description

We want to demonstrate that our analyais strategy (scanner-specific strategy) outperforms the conventional one for T1-weighted structural MRI Data.

## Application 

Neuroimaging research is a collaborative effort, collaborative networks of researchers working together on a range of large-scale studies have been initiated.

A prominent issue with a multicentre study is the heterogeneity of the data from scanners with different manufacturers (Siemens, GE, Philips…) and field strength (1.5T, 3T…).
