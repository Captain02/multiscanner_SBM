# Source-based morphometry for multi-centre MRI studies
## Project Description

We demonstrate that our analyais strategy (scanner-specific strategy) outperforms the conventional one for the multi-centre MRI study.

## Application 

Neuroimaging research is a collaborative effort, collaborative networks of researchers working together on a range of large-scale studies have been initiated.

A prominent issue with a multicentre study is the heterogeneity of the data from scanners with different manufacturers (Siemens, GE, Philips…) and field strength (1.5 T, 3.0 T…).

We demonstrated that our proposed scanner-specific analysis strategy outperformed the conventional analysis strategy. Therefore, the proposed analysis strategy is recommended when one applies source-based morphometry in a multi-centre MRI study.
